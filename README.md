                    <p class="leading-relaxed">Sujay works so hard and tirelessly on this bot, coding for days at a time. Its unbelievable the commitment and time he puts into this, and the outcome is amazing! He is so dedicated to making a bot that is user friendly, fun to play with, and unique from any other bots. Even when there are seemingly unsolvable errors or other problems and bugs, he does not stop until he solves them. In my opinion, as well as the opinions of many others, this pokemon bot is destined to be the best of all discord pokemon bots, and its all thanks to Sujay! I think that he would be a great candidate for any job, because he is very committed, smart, friendly, and works very well with others, all of which I've seen firsthand during the development of this bot. He is good at taking suggestions and implementing them in a way he believe is best, as well as coming up with his own great ideas. He is a great coder/programmer and this bot is only an example of his many capabilities.</p>

He codes for hours on end, every day and its inspired me to create my own Pokebot. Sujay is very funny and a great person. I want to see this bot grow and become the best, and I believe Sujay and this community can do it, together. Its easy to forget the time and play this bot for hours. Thanks Sujay for this amazing bot.</p>

His bot isnt done and we are all having a blast playing with it and all the different features it has. I love how it has its own feel to it even though its a pokemon bot. I can only immagine what it will look like when its finished, also thanks to everyone who is helping with this project you all also make this possible.:heartpulse::heartpulse:</p>

                        He has devoted so much of his time into this bot he works constantly and vigilantly to keep it running and fix any issues that come up. The bot is still unfinished but he works tirelessly to add stuff and get it to a finished product. He is very open minded with peoples suggestions as long as they are reasonable and works quickly to implement them. Sometimes he really needs a break though we appreciate how hard he works for us but we also care about his well being and want him to be alright. We love you Ken keep up the good work but remember to take some time for yourself occasionally!

                      <p class="leading-relaxed">It is so rare to meet creators like Ken to steal a time just to have a Chitchat while getting things working at the same time, dedication's there of course. at first I thought my experience here if I join here and grind my account out will be too much intimidating 'cause well you know life experiences with different worst people in our own perspectives might linger our view with the group. 

                        giving a little background as to what I see in the curent state of the bot. it's just like other pokemon entertainment bot. capture pokemon buy items fight gyms or trials or whatever you call that nowadays. but what makes it different? what makes it different even to the core pokemon games? what is it you say? take the idea of pokemon GO where you can raid battle pokemons. to the obvious idea of core games but replace mostly by typing it on your keyboad or tapping your phone, merge it into one added feature of ease of communication with the creator himself. thats the Blazibot i tell you there are so many features the will still be coming 'cause of course when i made this it's still in beta era. but who cares, creator's having fun, mods having fun, whatever role you know is having fun all of us are having fun. heck you can even submit you're own ideal pokemon! where else can you do that aside here eh?
                        
                        let's talk about the people joined. first creator himself. He is accomodative to the point that when I had joined here i thought he was just some person helping  me walking through the stuffs around here and I only knew he was the creator when I went to the other rooms and found this and also checking his role. next Mods, i just talked to one of them but heck its quite comfortable to talk to them as if theyre not the one's helping  to control of the group. haven't tried out the gymsthough but i bet its as good as my experience here.</p>

                               Coming up on 1 year now that I've known him...
                        This is going to take a minute to say what I want to say, sorry
                           I want to start by just saying he is hands down a python expert, he may not know every single thing but what he does not know that stops him he figures out one way or another and does exactly what he wanted to do. He is definitely more capable than any I've met on discord or any other online platforms.
                            I want to list some of the things that set him apart from all the other developers, as well as some things I consider noteworthy about him as a human being:

                        𝘼𝙨 𝙖 𝘿𝙚𝙫𝙚𝙡𝙤𝙥𝙚𝙧 and FRIEND
                        :arrow2: In the 10 months or so I've known Sujay his love for code and creating stuff has really been an inspiration. We started out just playing pokecord, on a server we were both invited to and asked to help out with- which grew into a close knit group of people while others came and went (you know who you are, but this is about Sujay sorry to leave out names). Pokecord obviously was sub-par and we moved onto   Mewbot. This is where I learned of his ability to code. I got his foot in the door with Dylee's Mewbot and got to observe how good he was. Many parts of the core of Mewbot were accomplished and made to what they are today either with Sujays aid, or totally based on something he coded. 
                        <br>
                        Duel system- Yup fundamentally it was flawed but he helped make it work.
                        Breeding- This was 100% coded by him originally I personally watched him trial and error until it worked.
                        I mention this only because it never was something he got credit for, as two developers bump heads with different ideas  he just walked away from it and didn't even once ask to bbe credited for his work, and pretty much no one knows it still. That's something worth stating In my opinion. 
                        <br>
                        At this point I remember him saying, "we could just make our own bot... and do it our way." I blew it off at first as I had no clue he was serious it seemed like an impossible amount of work and he just kept on saying it... As if it was something easy. I finally caved and said yeah let's do it... It was at this point that we settled on te name :blazingtoken:blazibot:blazingtoken:  and this is when it all started. He has built this entire bot from the ground up, refusing to copy annyone else's code, for any single part.  To be  honest, he won't even hardly look at other code unless I threaten him with violence (kidding....kinda). This is a true developer with a passion for what he does. He has completely rewritten Blazibot, alone,  more than three times to get it to what it is today. I'm convinced that he isn't going to stop until It's exactly what he had envisioned, nothing has been able to stop him this far- I am certain that nothing will either.
                        You've done amazing things with this Sujay, I'm absolutely stunned by how far you've come with it, and even though life has been up and down you've not given up. That's the definition of epic right there, ain't no one going to convince me otherwise.</p>
